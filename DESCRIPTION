Description:  Provides tools for simulating draws from continuous time processes with well-defined exponential family random graph (ERGM) equilibria, i.e. ERGM generating processes (EGPs).  A number of EGPs are supported, including the families identified in Butts (2023) <doi:10.1080/0022250X.2023.2180001>, as are functions for hazard calculation and timing calibration.
